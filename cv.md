About Myself
My name is Alex and I have been doing layout since 2022.
I enjoy layout, i've just started learning and developing in the field of front-end.
I like to listen to music, I also play the guitar and writing music for my band.
I dream of buying a small recording studio and playing it for my own pleasure when I want to relax after a hard day's work.
