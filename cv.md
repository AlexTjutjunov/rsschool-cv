About Myself
My name is Alex and I have been doing layout since 2022.I enjoy layout, 
I'v just start learning and developing in the field of front-end.
I like to listen to music, I also know how to play the guitar, i writing music for my band.
I dream of buying a small recording studio and playing it for my own pleasure when I want to relax after a hard day's work.
